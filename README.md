# PixelDB â€“ Lightweight Embeddable Database for AI-Powered Code Analysis

PixelDB is a minimalist, embeddable in-memory database for C, designed for developers building high-performance tools that require fast storage and retrieval of structured data.

While PixelDB starts as a general key-value store, it is designed with future AI/ML applications in mind, such as:

* Storing vector embeddings of code snippets
* Caching features extracted from source code
* Supporting next-generation static analysis tools that use AI to detect vulnerabilities

## Key Features

* Minimal and fast: Pure C, zero external dependencies, perfect for embedding in tools and microservices.
* TDD-driven: Fully tested with Unity for reliability and maintainability.
* Flexible and extensible: Start with general key-value storage, evolve into vector storage and AI-ready data structures.
* Practical for developers: Ideal for storing code metadata, snippet features, or ML embeddings during static analysis or other runtime tasks.

PixelDB is perfect for AI-enhanced cybersecurity tooling, enabling developers to experiment with intelligent vulnerability detection while keeping memory footprint low and performance high.
